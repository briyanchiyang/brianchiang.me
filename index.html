                    <p>I'm a sophomore pursuing a Computer Science + Math double major at Dartmouth College.
                        I'm currently working full-time at the Minds, Machine and Society lab under Prof. Soroush Vosoughi and grad.
                        student Weicheng Ma to detect intersectional stereotype biases in language models. In my spare time,
                        I debate competitively for Dartmouth, fence, play way too much Smash Bros, and am a big Golden State fan.
